STEP 1: Create a project on intelJ
Open ypur intellij
Click on New Project/File>New>Project
Click Next Next
Name : my_github_project
----------------------
STEP 2: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
*Repository(git repo) means github project folders. We must create a repository to store projects.
*We already installed git.
*****Steps for creating a repository
 https://github.com/ and login
 ***. click on your profile
***. click on your Repositories ***. click on New
***. repository name : my-first-git-repo
***. select public or private then create
---------------------
STEP 3: PUSH THE FIRST CODE TO GUTHUB
*Open intellij terminal
*Then follow the instruction on github!!!!
        *git init
        : Done only once for each project.This is used for initilizing the project. This will create .git forlder to store the project versions!!!
NOTE: If you see :  The term 'git' is not recognized
It means github installation is not complete
Then get in touch with teach support
        *git add .
        : Done after each code change.
        : Adds the code in the staging area
        *git commit -m "my first commit"
        : Done after each code change
        : This is used for creating new version of the project
        *git branch -M main
        :Done once for each project
        *git remote add origin https://github.com/abayramus/my-first-git-repo.git
        :Done once for each project
        *git push -u origin main
        :Done once for each project
***If your code is successfully pushed, then you should refresh your github and see your code in github
DONE*****
*********Git Push Practice*********
After the first push, we do not use some of teh git commets that we used in the first commit.
1. Create a new java class under src : FirstJavaClass
2. Create a main method and write code:
public class FirstJavaClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Learning github");
    }
}
3. Then push this code to the same repository
    *git add .
    *git commit -m "second commit"
    *git push
***********************************************
HOW TO PULL THE CODE FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL COMPUTER
*Create a new file : test_file.txt
*Add some comments :
Do not delete this file.
This file is Ms. Filiz's code
*Commit new file
***Now we created a file in github
We will get that code from github to intelliJ.
In intelliJ terminal write below commend to pull the code
    *git pull
***USEFULL COMMANDS:
git status :
This is our friend
We see the status of our codes
We can use this anytime to see where you are
